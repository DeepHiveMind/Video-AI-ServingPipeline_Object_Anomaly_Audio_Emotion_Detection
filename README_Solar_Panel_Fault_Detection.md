# Solar_Panel_Fault_Detection
# Photovoltaic Fault Detector


This repository contains code, data and model for Sonal Panel Fault detection implemention of trained model, you can use this code for predict a folder of images and have a output image with detection boxes.

## Type of Data
The images used for the design of this model were extracted by air analysis, specifically: FLIR aerial radiometric thermal infrared pictures, taken by UAV (R-JPEG format). Which were converted into .jpg images for the training of these detection models



## Solar Panel Multi class Classification
- CNN model to perform multiple faults in Solar Panels:  
### Type of Fault
#### 1: Soiling Fault
#### 2: Affected Cell 
#### 4: Diode Fault
#### disc: Panel Disconnected


## Solar Panel Binary Classification
- CNN model to predict if the solar panel is **Faulty** or **Not**
